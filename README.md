# About IRONBALL

IRONBALL is a cutting-edge platform that leverages blockchain technology to empower creators and organizations with innovative funding solutions. At its core, IRONBALL introduces refundable NFTs, a unique model where funds are locked in ETH, staked to generate yield, and made available for creators. This ensures supporters can back projects confidently, knowing their funds remain secure and even refundable after a lock period.

Key features of IRONBALL include:

* **Refundable NFTs**: Back creators without losing funds, with the option to refund after the lock period.
* **Yield Generation**: Locked ETH is staked, generating recurring income for creators.
* **Community Focus**: Designed to serve charities and content creators while redistributing platform income into the HONO ecosystem.
* **Flexible Upgrades**: Supporters can upgrade their NFTs at any time, enhancing their engagement and rewards.

IRONBALL is more than a funding platform; itâ€™s a sustainable ecosystem supporting innovation and impact. Join us to create a future where funding is secure, rewarding, and community-driven.
