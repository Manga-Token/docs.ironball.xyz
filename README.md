### 3. PROTOCOL VS. APPLICATION

The Application is merely one among numerous web-hosted user interfaces allowing you to access the Protocol, it does not process any transactions involving Digital Assets nor any other blockchain transactions. You hereby acknowledge the distinction between the Protocol and the Application, and that we are not responsible for the Protocol's operation, performance, or functioning. The Protocol is self-governing, autonomous and decentralised, and we are not involved in its operation or management in any way.

The Protocol consists of open-source smart contracts deployed on blockchain network(s) that function in a decentralised and autonomous manner. These smart contracts can be reviewed, verified, utilised, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone, subject to the terms of the applicable licences. Before using the Protocol and any underlying software, you should carefully review and assess them, as any use is at your own risk. You should always do your own research.

We neither control nor influence the Protocol in any way, and moreover, we possess no means to do so. Likewise, we do not control the underlying blockchain networks on which the Protocol is deployed, as well as any software through which such networks are formed. Accordingly, in no event shall we be responsible for or held liable in connection with the Protocol, underlying blockchain networks or software, their operation, functioning, implementation, or use, and you hereby assume and accept any and all related risks, including the risk of possible losses and damages that you may incur in connection with the use thereof.

For more details concerning the Protocol, please refer to the information and materials available on the Website and in the Documentation, which information and materials are provided for the information purposes only, are not binding and do not form a part of these Terms.

### 4. DIGITAL WALLET

When using Application, you may connect your Digital Wallet through one of the compatible third-party software wallets, such as, for illustration purposes only, MetaMask, TrustWallet, WalletConnect and alike (if and as may be made available). Software wallets constitute Third-Party Services and we are not responsible for, do not endorse, shall not be held liable in connection with, and do not make any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the software wallets used by you with the Application or otherwise. When using third-party software wallets, you should review applicable terms and policies that govern your use thereof. We never receive access to or control over your Digital Wallet or Digital Assets held in such Digital Wallet. Therefore, you are solely responsible for securing your Digital Wallet and credentials thereto (including private key, seed phrase, password, etc.). You may disconnect your Digital Wallet from the Application at any time.

### 5. ELIGIBILITY

To be eligible to access and use the Website, you must:

1. be able to form a legally binding agreement with us on terms herein set forth;
2. if an individual, be at least 18 (eighteen) years of age, or of such higher age required to enter into a binding agreement with us on the terms set out herein according to the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside;
3. neither be a Prohibited Person nor use the Platform for the benefit of a Prohibited Person; and
4. comply with these Terms.

To be eligible to access and use the Application, you must:

1. meet the eligibility requirements set out in items (i) through (iv) of this Section 5; and
2. use the Application for your business purposes only, and not as a consumer, and you hereby further agree and acknowledge that the Application is available for your commercial use only. You are not allowed to use the Application in your capacity as a consumer.

### 6. DISCLAIMERS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

You hereby acknowledge and agree that we do not provide any custodial or similar services, custodial solutions or software, nor do we act as your agent or representative. We do not control, manage, or custody any of your Digital Assets.

We shall not be held responsible or liable for any operations carried out by you or any other person with the use of, or through, the Application, including the receipt, use, storage, or disposition of Digital Assets. We do not act as an intermediary or party to any transaction made through the Application and shall not be responsible for ensuring the completion or performance of any transaction made on the blockchain. We do not control or influence transactions involving Digital Assets and cannot cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions conducted by you or any other user. You are responsible for ensuring that all your transactions comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Digital Assets are highly volatile, meaning their value, price and exchange rates may change dramatically in a short time due to various factors and forces. Certain Digital Assets may lose their value entirely. The composition of Digital Assets supplied to certain Third-Party Services, such as AMMs, may change, and their value may rise, fall, or drop significantly.

We do not facilitate or intermediate your interactions with the Protocol or Third-Party Services and shall not be responsible or held liable for any damages or losses you may incur as a result of changes in the composition, value, or price of your Digital Assets.

We are not your broker, fund manager, or any intermediary to any broker or fund manager. Nothing contained herein or on the Platform shall be considered as broker and/or fund management services, or any intermediation services related thereto.

We do not provide financial advisory, legal, regulatory, or tax services directly, indirectly, implicitly, or in any other manner, and you should not consider any content contained in these Terms, information, or materials provided by us (or on our behalf), as well as on the Website or in the Documentation, to be a substitute for professional financial, legal, regulatory, tax, or other advice.

The terms “investment”, “investing”, “deposit”, and other similar terms, as may be used in the Application, on the Website, in the Documentation, as well as in other materials provided to you in connection with the Platform, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of decentralised smart-contracts and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions by people.

The Platform, including any information and materials available thereon, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or Digital Assets or a solicitation for investment in, or purchase of securities or Digital Assets in any jurisdiction, nor is it intended to constitute a prospectus or offer document of any type. We do not provide any opinion or advice to purchase, sell, or otherwise transact with Digital Assets, and nothing communicated by us shall form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Please consult your own legal or financial advisor before making any decision and always conduct your own research.

The notice must include your name, address and email, and such other information necessary to identify you or assess your inquiry, describe the nature and basis of the Dispute and set forth the specific relief sought. If we and you cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, in accordance with the terms set forth below.

Any Disputes arising out of or in connection with the Platform, these Terms, or any matters contemplated herein, including any question regarding the existence, validity, or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the binding arbitration under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. The number of arbitrators shall be one (1). The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The arbitration hearing shall be conducted digitally by conference call, videoconference, or using other communications technology. Any and all notices, requests, demands, and other communications which are required or may be given in connection with the arbitration shall be sent in electronic form, either via email or other electronic means including via any electronic filing system operated by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. Any and all notices, requests, demands, and other communications sent by electronic means shall be treated as having been received by a recipient on the day it is transmitted (such time to be determined by reference to the recipient’s time zone). Unless otherwise required by the applicable law, and to the maximum extent permitted and possible, you, we, and the arbitrators shall maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Disputes. Unless prohibited under the law, the arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality.

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding in any circumstances. There will be no class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration where an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable law, you and we hereby waive the rights to a jury trial, class action arbitration, and to have any Dispute resolved in court.

To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable law, you and we hereby agree that any claim arising out of or related to the Platform, these Terms, or any matters contemplated herein shall be filed within one (1) year after the ground for such claim arose; if the claim is not filed within this term, such claim shall be permanently barred, which means that neither you nor we will have the right to assert such claim.
