### **A Revolutionary Take on NFTs**

IRONBALL NFTs follow the ERC721 standard but with a groundbreaking twist. When you mint an NFT, your ETH is securely locked in the contract for a duration set by the collectionâ€™s creator, providing both stability and transparency.

### **Built-In Security**

Creators have no access to the locked funds, eliminating the risk of a "rug pull." Their earnings come exclusively from the yield generated by the Total Value Locked (TVL), ensuring trust and alignment with supporters.

### **Effortless Refunds**

After the lock period, your NFT becomes essentially free to own. If you choose to opt out, you can claim a full refund. The NFT is burned, and your ETH is returned, making the process seamless, flexible, and low-risk for supporters.

### **Re-Minting Keeps It Dynamic**

When an NFT is refunded and burned, it becomes available for someone else to mint. This keeps collections vibrant and ever-evolving, fostering ongoing engagement.
