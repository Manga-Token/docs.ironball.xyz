# Upgrade

## **What is Upgrade?**

IRONBALL offers "Upgrade" as a standout feature for NFTs, designed to deepen the connection between supporters and creators.

If NFT holders wish to show their unwavering support for a creator or project, they can voluntarily upgrade their NFT. By upgrading, the initial mint value (the locked ETH) is transferred directly to the creator, transforming the NFT into a symbol of trust and dedication. This choice is entirely at the discretion of the NFT holder.

### **Incentives for Upgrading**

Creators can motivate holders to upgrade by offering tailored rewards, such as exclusive content, special discounts, airdrops, or other perks that show appreciation for their enhanced support.

### **Key Points to Know**

* **Irrevocable Change**: Once upgraded, the NFT is no longer refundable. It becomes a permanent part of the collection.
* **Temporary Transfer Lock**: Upgraded NFTs are locked from transfer or sale for 7 days, ensuring stability and reinforcing commitment.
