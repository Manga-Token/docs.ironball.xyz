# Use cases

### **A Fresh Approach to Subscriptions**

Imagine a content creator offering premium access to exclusive content or services. Instead of traditional subscriptions, they issue 10,000 NFTs through IRONBALL, each priced at 0.1 ETH, with a one-year lock period. This setup secures yield from the locked ETH, which could amount to \~3% annually (30 ETH), and creates opportunities for additional income via secondary market royalties and platform incentives.

### **How It Works for Supporters**

Supporters interested in the exclusive content mint an NFT by locking 0.1 ETH. Ownership of this NFT grants them continuous access to the creator's content. After the lock period, holders can either retain the NFT for ongoing benefits or claim a full refund, freeing up the slot for new supporters.

### **Market Opportunities**

Holders not only enjoy secure access and refundability but can also benefit from secondary market dynamics. Limited NFT supply means growing demand could lead to price appreciation, allowing holders to profit if they choose to sell their NFTs before the lock period ends.

### **Mutual Benefits for Creators and Supporters**

Creators earn yield from the locked ETH during the lock period, while supporters enjoy a flexible and risk-free model of access. Post-lock period, supporters can claim a full refund if they decide to exit, with their NFTs burned to open up space for new participants. This creates an engaging, sustainable model for memberships.

### **Versatility for All Projects**

Whether you're building subscription-based services, creating NFT-gated communities, launching a DAO, fundraising for an event, or offering digital art, IRONBALL NFTs adapt seamlessly to your vision, providing a secure, innovative, and flexible foundation for success.
