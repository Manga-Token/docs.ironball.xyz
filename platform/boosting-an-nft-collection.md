# Boosting an NFT collection

**Give Your Favorite Collections a Spotlight:** Boosting is a feature on IRONBALL that allows you to help NFT collections you believe in gain more visibility. By staking a small amount of ETH, you can ‘boost’ a collection, increasing its exposure to the IRONBALL community and driving more interest and engagement.

**Earn Rewards for Supporting:** Boosters may be eligible for future incentives as a token of appreciation for their role in promoting collections within the ecosystem.

**How to Boost:**

### **Step 1: Choose a Collection to Support**

Browse the NFT collections available on IRONBALL and select one you’d like to promote. Click the "Boost" button to start.

### **Boosting helps a project a zero cost!**

#### **Increase Visibility**

Your boost helps move the collection higher in IRONBALL’s featured section, enhancing its visibility and attracting more supporters.

#### **Withdraw Anytime**

Unlike other features, boosts are fully flexible. You can withdraw your staked ETH at any time without any fees or penalties, ensuring that your support remains entirely on your terms.

### Conclusion

Boosting is more than just a promotional tool; it’s a way to actively shape the IRONBALL ecosystem by championing the collections you believe in. Whether you're supporting a project you admire or simply contributing to the community, boosting makes your voice heard—and it’s risk-free.
