Pick the artwork of your choosing and upload it to the platform. If you prefer to have unique images for each NFT, here is a simple tutorial on uploading your art and metadata to IPFS.

And fill in your minting specifications. By default, all mints come with a 30-day lock period; this means minters will not be able to refund their NFTs within the first 30 days after minting.

To ensure fairness and prevent any single individual or group from hoarding too many NFTs, you can limit the number of NFTs a single wallet can mint in a single transaction

or the absolute number of NFTs a wallet can mint & hold.

This approach helps distribute your collection more evenly among supporters, fostering a broader community.
