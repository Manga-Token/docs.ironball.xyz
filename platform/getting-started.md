# Getting Started

1. **Connect Your Wallet:** Begin by connecting your Metamask or any EVM compatible wallets to the Ethereum Mainnet. Don't worry about the network settings; we'll automatically switch you to the Ethereum Mainnet for a smooth experience.
2. **Ensure Sufficient Funds:** To start creating and minting NFTs, you'll need to have funds on the Ethereum Mainnet. Use official platforms like Metamask or centralised exchange like Binance to top up ETH into your wallet.
